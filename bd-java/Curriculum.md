# Curriculum - Java

BloomTech’s Backend Development course is based on the success of Amazon Technical Academy, which trains non-technical Amazon employees for software development engineering roles within the company. Our program covers the same critical knowledge and skills required to succeed as a backend developer or software engineer, without needing a 4-year CS degree.

-   Learn from expert instructors and hands-on assignments
-   Work in teams to build real products for real clients
-   Code along live with industry professionals

Using Java, DynamoDB, Concurrency, and other current technologies, you’ll gain the specialized experience needed to launch your career in backend development.
